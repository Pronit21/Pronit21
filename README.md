Hey there! 👋 I'm Pronit Parida, a passionate programmer and tech enthusiast. Here are a few things about me:

I'm fluent in English, Hindi, Oriya, and Bengali. I'm also a beginner in French.
I can write code in Java ☕, C, Python, HTML/CSS and JavaScript 🔨.
Databases I have worked upon are MySQL and MongoDB.
I've worked with frameworks like Express.js, React.js ⚛️, and Flask.
Completed courses in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), Network Security, Database Management Systems (DBMS), and Compiler Construction.
In my free time, I enjoy playing Lawn Tennis 🎾 ,hitting the gym 💪, reading fiction books 📚, watching movies, and of course, coding!
I prefer using Light Mode over Dark Mode, and I'm a night owl 🌃 and a bit of a workaholic.
